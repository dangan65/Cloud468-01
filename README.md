# Cloud468-01
•	Alpine Linux
o	Serves as the foundational Linux distro
o	Fast startup time due to minimal size 
o	Ideal for cloud-native and containerized environments
•	Node.js (Alpine-based)
o	Application layer
o	Supports lightweight servers or scripts running inside containers
o	Alpine-based Node images minimize resource usage while maintaining functionality
•	Python (Alpine-based)
o	Used for scripting, automation, or processing tasks
o	Provides a clean runtime environment without unnecessary system overhead
o	Works well for demonstrating containerized workloads and inter-container communication
Using Alpine-based Node and Python images combines efficiency and portability, which are fundamentals of cloud computing. 
The goals I want to achieve are
•	Minimal container design
•	Separation of concerns across services
•	Best practices for building scalable and maintainable containerized systems
